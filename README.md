# Sports Scheduler

This is my capstone project of Full Stack Web Development, as part of it, I developed a full stack web application called **Sports Scheduler** using express.js node.js and postgresql. This application allows administrators(Admin) to create and manage sports and participants to create and join sports sessions.

## Features

- **Administrator Functions:**

- **Participant Functions:**
  - Create and join sports sessions.
  - View upcoming and past sessions.
